# Plant-Disease-Detection-Using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to automatically detect plant diseases from leaf images. The model is trained on labelled datasets to identify and classify common diseases with high accuracy, enabling faster and more reliable diagnosis for agricultural applications.
